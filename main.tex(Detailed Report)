\subsection{Distribution of Cholesterol Level for Different Chances of Heart Attack}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/Saved Pictures/download (12).png} % Adjust width as needed
\end{center}
\subsubsection*{Higher Chance vs. Lower Chance of Heart Attack:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cholesterol Levels 120-260}: There seems to be a higher count of individuals with a higher chance of heart attack compared to those with a lower chance in these intervals.
    \item \textbf{Cholesterol Levels 280-300}: The count shifts, showing more individuals with a lower chance of heart attack compared to those with a higher chance.
    \item \textbf{Cholesterol Levels 300-320}: There is again a higher count of individuals with a higher chance of heart attack compared to those with a lower chance.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Specific Intervals:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cholesterol Levels 180-200}: Shows a relatively high count of individuals with a higher chance of heart attack compared to those with a lower chance.
    \item \textbf{Cholesterol Levels 220-240}: Also shows a noticeable difference between higher and lower chances, with more individuals in the higher chance category.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Outlier Detection:}
The presence of outliers, especially at the extreme ends of the cholesterol spectrum (e.g., levels above 400), indicates cases that might warrant special attention due to their potential impact on heart health.

\subsubsection*{Distribution and Risk Assessment:}
These insights suggest that cholesterol levels within certain ranges might correlate with a higher likelihood of heart attack. This information could be valuable for risk assessment and preventive measures in clinical settings.

\subsection{Distribution of Blood Pressure for Different Chances of Heart Attack}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/Saved Pictures/download (13).png} % Adjust width as needed
\end{center}
\subsubsection*{Higher Chance of Heart Attack vs. Lower Chance:}
Intervals where the count of individuals with a higher chance of heart attack is noticeably higher than those with a lower chance can indicate potential risk factors associated with higher blood pressure.

\subsubsection*{Distribution Patterns:}
The distribution shows a varying pattern across different intervals. For instance, intervals around 120-125 and 130-135 show a significant number of individuals with both higher and lower chances of heart attack, indicating that blood pressure alone may not be a definitive indicator without considering other factors.

\subsubsection*{Risk Assessment:}
Higher counts in certain intervals, such as 120-125 and 130-135, suggest these ranges might be critical for assessing cardiovascular risk. This aligns with medical understanding that blood pressure within specific ranges can impact heart health differently for different individuals.

\subsubsection*{Potential Outliers:}
Although not explicitly noted here, outliers (such as extremely high or low values) in blood pressure could be crucial in understanding extreme risk cases that deviate significantly from typical patterns observed in the dataset.

\subsubsection*{Clinical Considerations:}
Clinically, these insights can guide healthcare professionals in identifying potential risk factors associated with blood pressure levels and their correlation with the likelihood of a heart attack. This understanding can lead to better preventive measures and personalized healthcare interventions.

\subsection{Distribution of Heart Rate for Different Chances of Heart Attack}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/Saved Pictures/download (14).png} % Adjust width as needed
\end{center}
\subsubsection*{Lower Heart Rates (80-100 bpm):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Individuals with lower heart rates (80-100 bpm) generally have a mix of lower and higher chances of heart attack.
    \item Lower chance intervals (e.g., 85-90 bpm, 90-95 bpm) tend to have fewer occurrences compared to higher chance intervals (e.g., 95-100 bpm).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Moderate Heart Rates (100-130 bpm):}
Heart rates in the range of 100-130 bpm show a broader distribution. There's a notable shift towards higher chances of heart attack as heart rate increases within this range (e.g., 110-115 bpm, 120-125 bpm).

\subsubsection*{Higher Heart Rates (130-180 bpm):}
Heart rates above 130 bpm generally show a higher incidence of heart attacks. Intervals like 130-135 bpm, 140-145 bpm, and 160-165 bpm consistently show higher chances of heart attack compared to lower chance intervals.

\subsubsection*{Very High Heart Rates (180-205 bpm):}
Very high heart rates (180-205 bpm) are less common but still indicate a higher chance of heart attack, albeit with fewer data points.

\subsection{Pair Plot}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/Saved Pictures/download (15).png} % Adjust width as needed
\end{center}
\subsubsection*{Age vs. Other Variables:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Age vs. Resting Blood Pressure (trtbps)}: There appears to be a slight positive correlation, suggesting that older individuals tend to have slightly higher resting blood pressure.
    \item \textbf{Age vs. Cholesterol Level (chol)}: There doesn't seem to be a strong linear trend, indicating that age alone may not significantly influence cholesterol levels.
    \item \textbf{Age vs. Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (thalachh)}: There's a noticeable downward trend as age increases, suggesting that older individuals generally achieve lower maximum heart rates.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Resting Blood Pressure (trtbps) vs. Other Variables:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Resting Blood Pressure vs. Cholesterol Level (chol)}: There doesn't appear to be a strong linear relationship between these variables, indicating that they may be independent factors.
    \item \textbf{Resting Blood Pressure vs. Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (thalachh)}: Similarly, there doesn't seem to be a clear linear relationship, suggesting independence or non-linear associations.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Cholesterol Level (chol) vs. Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (thalachh):}
There appears to be no strong linear correlation between cholesterol levels and maximum heart rates achieved. This suggests that these variables may not directly influence each other linearly in the dataset.

\subsubsection*{Effect of Output (Chance of Heart Attack):}
The hue (output) shows how the distribution of each variable differs between individuals with a lower chance (0) and a higher chance (1) of heart attack. For instance, in the age vs. thalachh plot, there's a noticeable concentration of higher chances of heart attack (orange) in older individuals with lower maximum heart rates.

\section*{3. Pattern Identification}

\subsection*{3.1 K-Means: Clustering Algorithm (2D)}

\subsubsection*{(i) Age and Cholesterol:}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/Saved Pictures/download (16).png} % Adjust width as needed
\end{center}
    Older individuals tend to cluster together with higher cholesterol levels, suggesting a potential correlation between age and cholesterol.
    Younger individuals are more spread out across the clusters, indicating diverse cholesterol levels.

\subsubsection*{(ii) Blood Pressure and Cholesterol:}
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/Saved Pictures/download (17).png} % Adjust width as needed
\end{center}
    Higher blood pressure readings tend to correlate with higher cholesterol levels in some clusters, particularly Cluster 1 (blue).
    Lower blood pressure readings are associated with varying cholesterol levels across different clusters.

\subsubsection*{Cluster Interpretation:}
    Cluster 1 (blue) may represent individuals at higher risk due to higher cholesterol levels and moderate blood pressure.
    Cluster 3 (yellow) suggests a younger group with higher blood pressure readings, indicating potential risk factors in younger demographics.

\subsubsection*{Practical Implications:}
    These clusters can help identify groups at higher risk of heart issues based on age, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels.
    Healthcare interventions and preventive measures could be targeted based on these identified clusters to mitigate potential risks associated with heart attacks.

                    \item Individuals in this cluster have varied conditions like restecg and thalachh, but all have fbs as 0.
                \end{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Cluster 2 (Green):}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Consists of individuals with very high cholesterol levels (295 to 327).
                    \item This cluster also includes individuals with severe heart conditions (ca=3 and thall=3).
                \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Heart Attack Risk (output):}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Individuals with higher cholesterol levels (above 295) mostly belong to cluster 2 and show varied output values (indicating both higher and lower chances of heart attack).
            \item Middle-aged individuals with moderate cholesterol levels (ranging from 204 to 214) and varying restecg values mostly belong to cluster 0 and have output values indicating higher chances of heart attack.
        \end{itemize}

            \item \textbf{Class 0 (Less chance of heart attack):} 0.90
            \item \textbf{Class 1 (More chance of heart attack):} 0.84
            \item Precision measures the proportion of true positives (correctly predicted cases) among all positive predictions. For class 0, it correctly identifies 90% of the patients who have less chance of a heart attack, while for class 1, it correctly identifies 84% of those who have more chance.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Recall (Sensitivity):}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Class 0:} 0.82
            \item \textbf{Class 1:} 0.91
            \item Recall measures the proportion of true positives that were correctly identified out of all actual positives. For class 0, 82% of patients with less chance of a heart attack were correctly identified, while for class 1, 91% of those with more chance were correctly identified.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{F1 Score:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Weighted Average:} 0.8776
            \item The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric to evaluate a model's performance. A higher F1 score indicates better overall performance in terms of both precision and recall.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{ROC-AUC Score:} 0.8665
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The ROC-AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under the Curve) score is a measure of the model's ability to distinguish between classes. An AUC score close to 1 suggests a good separation between classes, with higher values indicating better performance.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Overall Model Performance:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The logistic regression model achieves a high accuracy and balanced precision and recall scores for both classes, indicating robust predictive capability across the dataset.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Class-Specific Insights:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Class 1 (more chance of heart attack) shows slightly higher recall than precision, indicating that the model is better at correctly identifying individuals at risk of a heart attack compared to those who are not at risk.
            \item Class 0 (less chance of heart attack) shows higher precision, meaning that when the model predicts someone as having less chance of a heart attack, it is usually correct.

    \item \textbf{Explanatory Power:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The R² value for Linear Regression (0.4994) is significantly higher than that of the Decision Tree Regressor (0.1455). This indicates that Linear Regression explains a larger portion of the variance in the target variable compared to the Decision Tree Regressor.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Model Complexity:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Linear Regression is a simple and interpretable model, which often works well for linear relationships between the features and the target variable. The lower MSE and higher R² suggest that in this case, a linear relationship might be more appropriate for your data.
            \item Decision Trees can capture non-linear relationships and interactions between features. However, in this case, it appears that the Decision Tree model is overfitting or not capturing the underlying pattern as effectively as the Linear Regression model.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Choosing the Right Model:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Based on the MSE and R² values, Linear Regression seems to be the better model for this specific dataset and problem. It provides more accurate predictions and explains a greater portion of the variance in the target variable.
            \item However, if the data has complex non-linear relationships, it might be worth exploring other non-linear models or tuning the hyperparameters of the Decision Tree Regressor to improve its performance.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Conclusion:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The Linear Regression model outperforms the Decision Tree Regressor in terms of both accuracy (lower MSE) and explanatory power (higher R²) for this dataset. It is likely a more suitable model for predicting the target variable given the provided metrics. However, it's important to consider the nature of the data and potentially explore other models or techniques to ensure the best possible predictive performance.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{FUTURE WORK:} 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Requires the Linear Regression and Decision tree regressor to be more accurate
\item Requires a massive Dataset for better accuracy of machine learning algorithum

\section*{Objective}
The goal of this project is to create an AI-driven solution that can efficiently process and analyze structured heart attack datasets to represent knowledge and generate valuable insights. This solution should identify patterns within the data and produce meaningful information to support decision-making processes.

\section*{Problem Description}
In today's era of big data, organizations across various sectors generate enormous amounts of data daily. Properly processing and analyzing this data can uncover valuable insights that greatly enhance decision-making processes. The challenge lies in effectively representing this knowledge and extracting useful insights. Your task is to develop an AI-based solution capable of addressing this challenge by processing a provided structured dataset, representing the knowledge within it, and generating meaningful insights.

    \item TRTBPS: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
    \item CHOL: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
    \item FBS: Fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg/dl, 1 = true; 0 = false)
    \item RESTECG: Resting electrocardiographic results (0 = normal, 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy)
    \item THALACHH: Maximum heart rate achieved
    \item EXNG: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
    \item OLDPEAK: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
    \item SLP: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0 = upsloping, 1 = flat, 2 = downsloping)
    \item CAA: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
    \item THALL: Thalassemia (1 = normal; 2 = fixed defect; 3 = reversible defect)
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Correlation: Weak positive correlation (0.21), indicating slight increase in cholesterol with age.
    \item Notable Cases: Oldest person (77 years) with cholesterol 304 mg/dl. Highest cholesterol (564 mg/dl) at age 67.

\vspace{50pt}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Age and Health Factors: Moderate positive correlation with resting blood pressure, moderate negative correlation with maximum heart rate achieved.
    \item Sex and Heart Health: Males might have a slightly higher likelihood of experiencing a heart attack.
    \item Heart Health Indicators: Moderate correlations with maximum heart rate, chest pain type, exercise-induced angina, and number of major vessels.
\end{itemize}
